### Common OpenStack Parameters
# The email address of the administrator user.
admin_email: root@localhost

# The userid to be assigned for the RPC backend service
# (e.g. RabbitMQ, Qpid, etc).

# The scheduler driver to be used for Cinder.
cinder::scheduler::scheduler_driver: 'cinder.scheduler.simple.SimpleScheduler'

# The libvirt VIF driver to be used for Quantum and Neutron.
# Both are present here in order to account for the name change

# The services and admin tenant names.

# Many manifests that install OpenStack packages can either ensure
# that a package is 'present' (e.g. installed) or that it is 'latest'
# (e.g. the puppet agent will check for a newer version on each
# catalog run and install a newer version if one is available in your
# package repository).  Using 'latest' could potentially be disruptive
# to your cloud, so use with caution.
package_ensure: present

# The libvirt driver to use for Nova.  This is set to Qemu by
# default to allow OpenStack to be deployed in nested virt setups
# (common in CI or automated testing setups), but is frequently
# overridden by a higher-level yaml file such as user.$scenario.yaml.
nova::compute::libvirt::libvirt_type: qemu

# The disk_cachemodes setting in nova.conf can be useful for
# improving the performance of instance launches and tuning
# I/O.  By default it's set to an empty list and therefore
# isn't propagated to nova.conf.  If you wish to set cachemodes,
# uncomment the lines below and adjust accordingly.
#nova::compute::libvirt::libvirt_disk_cachemodes:
#  - 'file=writethrough'

# The IP address on which vncserver should listen.  Setting to

nova::compute::libvirt::vncserver_listen: 0.0.0.0

# enable nova to do live migration
# vncserver_listen also must be set to 0.0.0.0
nova::compute::libvirt::migration_support: true

# Set the libvirt CPU mode.  Setting 'false' here will use
# 'host-model' on Qemu/KVM and 'None' on other hypervisors.
# For most users the defaults are fine, but you may wish to
# change the setting if you're using nested virtualization or
# wish to expose different CPU settings.
nova::compute::libvirt::libvirt_cpu_mode: false

# Normally Nova uses the metadata service to pass configuration data
# to instances.  However the metadata services depends on network
# connectivity and can be problematic in some scenarios.  An alternative
# is to use the force_config_drive setting in nova.conf, which tells
# Nova to always create a config drive and force injection to take place
# for each instance launched.
nova::compute::force_config_drive: true

### Package repository setup
# These directives set up the package repository to be used when
# installing OpenStack software.  These settings may be overridden
# in data/hiera_data/vendor/* files if using a specific vendor's
# repositories.

# The package repository to be used. Valid values include 'cloud_archive'
# (use the Ubuntu Cloud Archive) and 'cisco_repo' (use the Cisco Systems
# OpenStack repository).
coe::base::package_repo: cloud_archive

# The base version of OpenStack to be installed (e.g. 'havana').
openstack_release: havana

# The name of the pocket to use for both
# the supplemental and main repos.  This setting may not be useful for
# all vendor repositories, so setting it to false or an empty string
# is usually safe.  Setting this to an empty string
# will generally point you to the stable pocket.  For the Cisco Systems
# repository you can can specify the -proposed pocket ('-proposed') to
# use unreleased development code or a snapshot ('/snapshots/h.0') to
# use code from prior Cisco releases.
pocket: false

# The 'openstack_repo_location' parameter should be the complete
# URL of the repository you want to use to fetch OpenStack
# packages (e.g. http://openstack-repo.cisco.com/openstack/cisco).
# This setting is not used by all vendors.
openstack_repo_location: false

# The 'supplemental_repo' parameter should be the complete URL
# of the repository you want to use for supplemental packages
# (e.g. http://openstack-repo.cisco.com/openstack/cisco_supplemental).
# This setting is not used by all vendors.
supplemental_repo: false


# If you wish to run a basic functionality test after the cloud is set
# up, you can set the type of image to be booted.  Use 'cirros' to
# use a Cirros image, or any other value to use an Ubuntu Precise image.
openstack::test_file::image_type: cirros

# Whether or not to install the ceilometer client library.
# This is often overridden in higher-layer yaml files.

# How to set the swift_store_user directive in swift.conf.
# This should be an account name and a username separated by
# a colon.
glance::backend::swift::swift_store_user: services:swift

# Whether or not to have swift create a container when it
# receives a PUT request.
glance::backend::swift::swift_store_create_container_on_put: true

# The type of backend storage to use for swift.  This can either be
# 'loopback' (use a loopback device which is useful if you don't have
# dedicated storage disks for swift) or 'disk' (a more performant
# option if you do have dedicated storage disks).  This is set to
# loopback by default since this value works on almost any setup,
# but will commonly be overridden in higher-level yaml files for
# production usage.
openstack::swift::storage-node::storage_type: loopback

# The disks or loopback devices to be used for Swift storage.
# If you are using dedicated disks, this will be a list of disk names
# (such as 'sdb').  If you are using loopback devices, this will
# be a list of filenames which will be created in /srv/loopback-device
# (you can specify an alternate location using
# openstack::storage::loopback::base_dir).
openstack::swift::storage-node::storage_devices:
  - 1

# The Apache MPM module to use on the build node.  Options may vary

### Tempest provisioning setup
# These parameters are used by Tempest to set up a bare OpenStack
# deployment and are only useful in all_in_one deployments.

# The URL of the identity service (keystone).
