# environment they will be usable *if* the above addresses are routeable
# from elsewhere in your network.

# Cobbler can instruct nodes being provisioned to start a Puppet agent

# MySQL server options
#
# override_options is used to pass a hash of options to be set in

#   bind-address: specifies the IP address on which the MySQL daemon listens
#   max-connections: specifies the number of simultaneous connections permitted
#   max_connect_errors: production deployments typically set this to 2^32-1
#
# In the isamchk section, key_buffer_size determines how much memory will be
# used to buffer index blocks for MyISAM tables
#
# Note that any other valid MySQL config file parameters can be added as
# needed by using this override_options mechanism. See override_options in

## NFS Live migration options ##
# If on a debian-based distro, you must also set the nova uid/gid
# when using live migration. This is not needed for RHEL distros
# as they predefine the uid/gid.

# You can also manage the nova user's uid and gid. You will have to enable

# be used on RedHat platforms, as they already predefine the uid/gid for the
# nova user.
